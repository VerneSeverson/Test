--------------General Usage Guidelines--------------
This project is intended to be included as a library in other projects as a subtree.  As such, only 
one branch is necessary: master. The remote projects can push and pull from this branch. 

If development work is being done directly in the ForwardLib project (i.e. not in a remote project),
it should be done on feature branches that are merged back into master when complete. The master 
branch must always be compilable.
